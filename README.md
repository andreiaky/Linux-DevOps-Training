# Linux DevOps Training

This is my repo where I keep the things I work on for the IBM DevOps Summer School. I decided to do the entire documentation in english as the exercises are in english too and is a good practice.

I decided to save on github what I worked on, as I consider it a good reference to use in the future. It will help me review things I learned during that time.
